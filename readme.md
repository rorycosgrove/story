# Story

## Description
A simple JavaScript API using Node, Express and Pug which allows a 
user to create a story with multiple paths.

## Installation
 <ol>
 <li> Extract the zip file to a new folder </li>
 <li> npm install</li>
 <li> npm start</li>
 <li> The application will be available at http://localhost:3000</li>
</ol>

## Approach
Keep it simple and as clean as possible in the time available.
<ul>
<li>A story is an array of paragraphs</li>
<li>Each paragraph can contain four possible sentences</li>
<li>When a sentence is populated, a new paragraph is created </li>
<li>The created paragraph has this sentence as its root</li>
</ul>


## Shortcuts
<ul>
<li>The initial root sentence is hard coded</li>
<li>The paragraph object should hold an array of sentences</li>
<li>The Pug template should iterate over this sentence array</li>
<li>Error handling for invalid URLs not implemented</li>
</ul>


## What is being tested?
<ol>
<li>Me!</li>
<li>Ability to create a minimum viable product within a short deadline</li>
<li>Working without client side JavaScript</li>
<li>Knowledge of REST principles and best practices</li>
<li>Efficient use of data structures</li>
<li>Paying attention to the restrictions so as to deliver the requirements as perscribed</li>
</ol>
